# Tag Game - Final Features Summary

## âœ… All Issues Fixed!

### 1. **Ghost Color Changes Based on Who is IT**
- **When Pacman is IT**: Ghost appears SCARED (Blue/White color) - runs away
- **When Ghost is IT**: Ghost appears AGGRESSIVE (Red color) - chases Pacman
- This is achieved by setting `scaredTimer = 999` when ghost should flee, `= 0` when chasing

### 2. **Ghost Uses Real Pacman AI Algorithm**
- Implemented **DirectionalGhost algorithm** from the original game
- Uses probability distribution for more realistic movement
- 80% chance of optimal move, 20% randomness (just like real Pacman ghosts!)
- Much smarter chasing behavior than simple distance minimization

### 3. **State Persistence Fixed**
- Custom `TagGameStateData` class properly preserves:
  - `pacman_is_it` - Who is currently IT
  - `tag_count` - Number of tags that have occurred
  - `move_count` - Total moves in the game
  - `tag_cooldown` - Prevents duplicate tag counting
- Fixed `deepCopy()` to maintain TagGameStateData type

### 4. **Tag Mechanics Working**
- âœ… Tags increment properly: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...
- âœ… Cooldown prevents duplicate tags (10 moves)
- âœ… Collision tolerance increased to 1.5 (easier to tag)
- âœ… Clear visual feedback when tags happen

### 5. **Behavior Switching**
- Both agents properly read state and switch behavior
- Debug messages every 50 moves show current state
- Visual indicators in tag announcements

## How to Play

### With Graphics (Recommended):
```bash
python runTag.py --keyboard --layout mediumClassic --maxTags 5 --frameTime 0.15
```

### Controls:
- **W** / **Up Arrow** - North
- **S** / **Down Arrow** - South
- **A** / **Left Arrow** - West
- **D** / **Right Arrow** - East

### Watch For:
1. **Ghost Color**: 
   - Blue/White = Ghost is scared, Pacman is chasing
   - Red = Ghost is aggressive, Ghost is chasing

2. **Tag Messages**: Big banner shows who becomes IT

3. **Status Updates**: Every 50 moves shows current behavior

## Technical Implementation

### Ghost AI (tagAgents.py)
```python
# When Pacman is IT:
ghostState.scaredTimer = 999  # Blue color, flee behavior

# When Ghost is IT:
ghostState.scaredTimer = 0    # Red color, chase behavior
```

### DirectionalGhost Algorithm:
1. Calculate all possible next positions
2. Compute distances to Pacman for each
3. Find best moves (min distance when chasing, max when fleeing)
4. Create probability distribution:
   - 80% to best moves
   - 20% distributed across all moves
5. Choose action from distribution (adds unpredictability)

### State Management (tagGame.py):
- `TagGameStateData` extends `GameStateData`
- Custom `deepCopy()` preserves tag attributes
- Ensures state persists across all game turns

## Expected Behavior

### Game Start:
- Pacman is IT (chasing)
- Ghost is Blue/Scared (fleeing)

### After First Tag:
- Ghost becomes IT (chasing)
- Ghost turns Red/Aggressive
- Pacman runs away
- Tag count = 1

### After Second Tag:
- Pacman is IT again
- Ghost turns Blue/Scared again
- Cycle continues

### Game End:
- When `maxTags` is reached (e.g., 5 tags)
- Or when `maxMoves` is reached (e.g., 1000 moves)

## Files Modified

1. **tagAgents.py** - Ghost AI with DirectionalGhost algorithm + color changing
2. **tagGame.py** - State persistence, tag detection, game rules
3. **runTag.py** - Main runner with keyboard support
4. **TAG_GAME_README.md** - Complete documentation

## Test It!

```bash
# Quick test with graphics
python runTag.py --keyboard --layout mediumClassic --maxTags 3

# Faster gameplay
python runTag.py --keyboard --layout mediumClassic --maxTags 5 --frameTime 0.1

# Text mode (no graphics)
python runTag.py --keyboard --layout mediumClassic --textGraphics --maxTags 5

# AI vs AI (watch them play)
python runTag.py --layout mediumClassic --maxTags 10 --frameTime 0.1
```

Enjoy the complete tag game experience! ðŸŽ®
