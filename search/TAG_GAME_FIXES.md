# Tag Game Improvements - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… **Easier Tagging**
- **Problem**: Tags were too difficult to achieve (collision tolerance was 0.7)
- **Solution**: Increased collision tolerance from 0.7 to 1.5 Manhattan distance
- **Result**: Tags happen more frequently when agents are close

### 2. âœ… **Visual Indicators for Who is IT**
- **Problem**: No clear indication of who is currently "IT"
- **Solution**: Added multiple visual indicators:
  - **Tag announcement** with big banner when a tag happens
  - **Status updates** every 20 moves showing who is IT
  - **Chase indication** in status messages
- **Example Output**:
  ```
  ============================================================
      *** TAG! TAG! TAG! ***
      GHOST IS NOW IT!
      Ghost will now chase Pacman!
      Tag Count: 2
  ============================================================
  
  [Move 40] IT: GHOST (Chasing) | Tags: 2 | Distance: 5.0
  ```

### 3. âœ… **Ghost AI Now Changes Behavior**
- **Problem**: Ghost wasn't switching between chase and flee modes
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed state attribute initialization in both agents
  - Ensured `pacman_is_it` attribute is properly preserved across game states
  - Added proper state checking in agent AI logic
  - Removed STOP action from ghost to keep it moving

- **How it works now**:
  - **When Pacman is IT**: Pacman chases â†’ Ghost flees
  - **When Ghost is IT**: Ghost chases â†’ Pacman flees

### 4. âœ… **Tag Count Fixed**
- **Problem**: Tag count wasn't incrementing properly (stuck at 1)
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed cooldown mechanism to prevent duplicate tags
  - Cooldown now properly decrements in `process()` method
  - Increased cooldown from 5 to 10 moves for better separation
  - Tags only register when cooldown is 0

### 5. âœ… **Game Doesn't End Prematurely**
- **Problem**: Game ended after first tag
- **Solution**: Override `_win` and `_lose` flags in every process cycle
- **Result**: Game only ends when maxTags or maxMoves is reached

## Technical Changes

### tagGame.py
- `checkTag()`: Increased tolerance to 1.5
- `handleTag()`: Fixed cooldown logic, added better visual messages
- `process()`: Added cooldown decrementation, status updates, state initialization
- Tag cooldown increased to 10 moves

### tagAgents.py
- `TagPacmanAgent`: 
  - Ensured `pacman_is_it` attribute exists
  - Removed STOP from legal actions
  - Added comments showing chase/flee logic clearly
  
- `TagGhostAgent`:
  - Ensured `pacman_is_it` attribute exists  
  - Removed STOP from legal actions
  - Fixed AI to properly switch between chase and flee

### runTag.py
- Improved startup banner
- Removed emoji characters (Windows console compatibility)
- Better final statistics display

## How to Play

### Quick Test (AI vs AI):
```bash
python runTag.py --layout mediumClassic --maxTags 5
```

### Keyboard Control:
```bash
python runTag.py --keyboard --layout mediumClassic --maxTags 5
```

### Fast-Paced Game:
```bash
python runTag.py --layout mediumClassic --maxTags 10 --frameTime 0.05
```

## Expected Behavior

1. **Game starts**: Pacman is IT, chases Ghost
2. **First tag**: Ghost becomes IT, roles reverse
3. **Status updates**: Every 20 moves shows who is IT and distance
4. **Tags increment**: Each successful tag increases count
5. **Game ends**: When tag limit or move limit is reached

## Verification

To verify it's working:
- Watch the banner messages when tags happen
- Check the status updates every 20 moves
- Observe agent behavior reversal after each tag
- Confirm tag count increments (1, 2, 3, ...)
- Make sure game continues until maxTags is reached

Enjoy the improved tag game! ðŸŽ®
