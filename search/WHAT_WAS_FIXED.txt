================================================================================
                         TAG GAME - WHAT WAS FIXED
================================================================================

ISSUE #1: Tag Counter Stuck at 1
---------------------------------
BEFORE: Tag count stayed at 1 no matter how many times you tagged
AFTER:  Tag count increments correctly: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ...

FIX: Created TagGameStateData and TagGameState classes to preserve custom
     attributes during state copies. Override generateSuccessor() to return
     TagGameState instead of GameState.


ISSUE #2: Ghost Color Not Changing
-----------------------------------
BEFORE: Ghost stayed same color whether IT or not
AFTER:  - Ghost is RED when Ghost is IT (chasing Pacman)
        - Ghost is BLUE/WHITE when Pacman is IT (running away)

FIX: Update ghost.scaredTimer in TagGameRules.process() EVERY frame:
     - scaredTimer = 999 when Pacman is IT (makes ghost blue)
     - scaredTimer = 0 when Ghost is IT (makes ghost red)


ISSUE #3: Ghost Going Through Walls
------------------------------------
BEFORE: Ghost escaped maze after being tagged, went off-screen
        Distance: 10.0 -> 47.5 -> 91.5 -> 141.5 (kept increasing)
AFTER:  Ghost stays within maze boundaries at all times

FIX: Override TagGhostRules.applyAction() to ALWAYS use speed=1.0
     (ignore scaredTimer for speed calculation). Also override
     decrementTimer() to not modify scaredTimer.
     
     REASON: Default GhostRules halves speed when scared (speed=0.5),
             causing fractional positions that escape the grid.


ISSUE #4: Ghost Not Chasing When IT
------------------------------------
BEFORE: Ghost behavior didn't change when becoming IT
AFTER:  - Ghost CHASES (minimizes distance) when IT
        - Ghost FLEES (maximizes distance) when not IT

FIX: TagGhostAgent already uses DirectionalGhost algorithm.
     The real issue was #1 (state not persisting), which prevented
     the pacman_is_it flag from being preserved.


ISSUE #5: Rapid Re-Tagging
---------------------------
BEFORE: Could tag multiple times rapidly
AFTER:  20-move cooldown between valid tags

FIX: Increased cooldown from 10 to 20 moves. Added debug messages
     showing when tags are ignored due to cooldown.


================================================================================
                              HOW TO TEST
================================================================================

1. Run the game:
   python runTag.py --keyboard --layout mediumClassic --maxTags 10

2. Chase the ghost (you start as IT). Ghost should be BLUE/WHITE and run away.

3. Tag the ghost by touching it.

4. Verify:
   - Message appears: "GHOST IS NOW IT!"
   - Ghost turns RED immediately
   - Ghost starts CHASING you
   - Tag count shows "Tag Count: 1"
   - Distance should be small and stay reasonable

5. Let ghost catch you.

6. Verify:
   - Message appears: "PACMAN IS NOW IT!"
   - Ghost turns BLUE/WHITE immediately
   - Ghost starts RUNNING AWAY
   - Tag count shows "Tag Count: 2"

7. Continue playing - tag count should keep incrementing.

8. Ghost should NEVER go through walls or off-screen.


================================================================================
                           KEY FILES MODIFIED
================================================================================

tagGame.py
----------
+ TagGameStateData class (preserves tag attributes in state copies)
+ TagGameState class (uses TagGameStateData, overrides generateSuccessor)
+ TagGameRules.process() - Updates ghost color every frame
+ TagGhostRules.applyAction() - Always uses normal speed
+ TagGhostRules.decrementTimer() - Doesn't modify scaredTimer

tagAgents.py
------------
+ TagGhostAgent uses DirectionalGhost algorithm (already implemented)
  No changes needed - works correctly once state persistence fixed


================================================================================
                              SUCCESS CRITERIA
================================================================================

✓ Tag count increments with each tag
✓ Ghost changes color (red/blue) when roles switch
✓ Ghost stays within maze boundaries
✓ Ghost behavior changes (chase/flee) when roles switch
✓ Cooldown prevents rapid re-tagging
✓ Game continues until maxTags or maxMoves reached
